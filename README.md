This is power bi project for the super store sales data

I started with robust ETL processes and data cleansing, ensuring our Superstore sales data is primed for analysis. Then, I dived into the world of data insights.

📊 My dashboard features cards displaying crucial metrics:

Total Sales 📈
Total Orders 📦
Total Customers 👥
Orders Returned 🔄
Best-Selling Product 🥇
I've also designed engaging visualizations to enhance our understanding:

Sales vs. Profit by Month 📅
Total Sales by Shipping Mode 🚚
Top 5 Products 🥇
Top 5 Employees 👨‍💼
Total Sales by Category 📦
The dashboard offers extensive filtering options, allowing us to dissect the data by Region, Year, State, Month, Category, and Sub-Category. 🧐

This project empowers data-driven decision-making and fuels our business growth. Proud of this achievement and eager to leverage these insights for our organization's benefit. 🚀
